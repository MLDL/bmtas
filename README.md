# Branched Multi-Task Architecture Search (BMTAS)

This repository provides example code for the BMVC 2020 paper [Automated Search for Resource-Efficient Branched Multi-Task Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10292).

## Overview

BMTAS is a principled method to automatically find branched multi-task networks for a given set of tasks. The goal is to obtain models which are both high-performing and efficient during inference. This is achieved by optimizing a supergraph through differentiable neural architecture search. The desired performance vs. efficiency trade-off is controlled via a proxyless, resource-aware loss.

We provide example code for searching branched networks based on a MobileNetV2 backbone and DeepLabv3+ head on the PASCAL-Context dataset. The dataset provides labels for five dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, human parts segmentation, saliency estimation, surface normal estimation and edge detection.

## Usage

### Requirements

The code was run in a `conda` environment with the packages listed in `bmtas_env.yml`. For a quick setup, use:

    conda env create -f bmtas_env.yml
    conda activate bmtas_env

### Architecture Search

To start an architecture search, use for example:

    python main_search.py --data_root ./PASCAL_MT --tasks semseg,human_parts,sal,normals,edge --resource_loss_weight 0.05

On the first run, this will also download the dataset.

### Branched Network Training

To train the branched network found via architecture search, supply the path to the corresponding `branch_config.json`:

    python main_branched.py --configuration </path/to/branch_config> --data_root ./PASCAL_MT --tasks semseg,human_parts,sal,normals,edge

Due to GPU memory constraints, multi-GPU training may be required. By default, branched network training is distributed across all available GPUs on the node.

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained branched network, supply the path to the corresponding `checkpoint.pth`:

    python main_test.py --model_path </path/to/checkpoint> --data_root ./PASCAL_MT

Note that the evaluation of edge detection is disabled, since the MATLAB-based [SEISM](https://github.com/jponttuset/seism) repository was used for obtaining the optimal dataset F-measure scores. Instead, the edge predictions are simply saved on the disk in this code.

## Differences to Paper Version

There are some minor differences between this version and the original code used for the paper:
- We use the Adam optimizer also for weights during the search - this way, we can avoid using a learning rate scheduler in the bilevel optimization.
- The learning rate is kept equal for all blocks when training the branched network, not adapted depending on the degree of operator sharing.
